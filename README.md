# UFOs: Mysteries unraveled... 
!![iamge of space](https://github.com/K-Sharma95/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/nasa.jpg)

## OVERVIEW: 
The purpose of this project is to access UFO sightings/information from McMinnville, Oregon. This respository contains Javascript and HTML code for the intended purpose of creating a dynamic and attractive webpage. This webpage will display a functioning table with data form [this data set.](https://github.com/K-Sharma95/UFOs/blob/main/static/js/data.js)

## ANALYSIS AND CHALLENGES: 
Access the webpage by cloning the [index.html](https://github.com/K-Sharma95/UFOs/blob/main/index.html) file and copying that path into your chrome browser. In order to conduct a search, first enter in your intended filter parameters, and then return for a list of relevant data.  

## RESULTS:
An initial drawback of this webpage is that it is very limited in terms of data available and accessability. This webpage only displays data from one data set, and does not consider other UFO sightings to information. In the future this webpage can be greatly improved by acquiring more data and updating the code to access more than one data set. Or perhaps design a way for user to submit their own UFO sightings directly on the webpage.
This would help users who are conducting their own research by allowing them to add to the data, improving the quality of information available. 
The resulting webpage is also containing a few errors preventing it from running correctly, and issue that will be fixed with future updates.
